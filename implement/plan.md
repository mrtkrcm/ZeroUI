# Implementation Plan - Security Hardening
**Session**: configtoggle-security-hardening-20250810  
**Start Time**: 2025-08-10T20:30:00Z

## Source Analysis
- **Source Type**: Critical security TODO items from codebase analysis
- **Core Features**: Path validation, resource limits, secure file operations
- **Dependencies**: Go filepath package, YAML parser limits, path validation utilities
- **Complexity**: Medium (security-critical implementations require careful validation)

## Target Integration
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Backup command path validation (cmd/backup.go)
  - YAML parser security limits (internal/config/loader.go)
  - File system operations hardening
- **Affected Files**: 
  - `cmd/backup.go` - Add path traversal protection
  - `internal/config/loader.go` - Add YAML complexity limits
  - New security utilities as needed
- **Pattern Matching**: Follow existing error handling, use structured validation

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Security Analysis & Setup
- [ ] Create new implementation session for security focus
- [ ] Analyze current security vulnerabilities in detail
- [ ] Review backup path handling for directory traversal risks
- [ ] Analyze YAML parsing for resource exhaustion vectors
- [ ] Design security validation framework

### Phase 2: Backup Path Security
- [ ] Implement path validation to prevent directory traversal
- [ ] Ensure backup paths stay within ~/.config/zeroui/backups/
- [ ] Add path canonicalization and boundary checking
- [ ] Test against common directory traversal attacks (../, symlinks)
- [ ] Add comprehensive security tests for path validation

### Phase 3: YAML Parser Hardening  
- [ ] Add YAML complexity limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Implement max file size, depth, and key count limits
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring during parsing
- [ ] Implement timeout protection for large YAML files
- [ ] Test against YAML bombs and deeply nested structures

### Phase 4: Security Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive security test suite
- [ ] Test directory traversal attack scenarios
- [ ] Test YAML resource exhaustion scenarios
- [ ] Validate all security boundaries work correctly
- [ ] Performance test security validations don't impact normal use

### Phase 5: Integration & Documentation
- [ ] Integrate security validations with existing error handling
- [ ] Update CLI help text to document security restrictions
- [ ] Add security best practices documentation
- [ ] Validate security implementations work across platforms
- [ ] Create security incident response guidelines

## Security Requirements

### Backup Path Security Goals
1. **Directory Traversal Prevention**
   - Block `../` path components
   - Prevent symlink exploitation
   - Validate paths stay within authorized directories
   - Use absolute path validation

2. **Path Boundary Enforcement**
   - Restrict to `~/.config/zeroui/backups/` directory
   - Validate canonical path resolution
   - Block access to system directories
   - Prevent overwriting critical files

### YAML Parser Security Goals
1. **Resource Exhaustion Prevention**
   - Maximum file size: 10MB
   - Maximum nesting depth: 50 levels
   - Maximum key count: 10,000 keys
   - Parse timeout: 30 seconds

2. **Memory Protection**
   - Monitor memory usage during parsing
   - Abort parsing if memory threshold exceeded
   - Implement streaming parser for large files
   - Add garbage collection hints for large operations

## Security Testing Strategy

### Attack Vector Testing
1. **Directory Traversal Tests**
   - `../../../etc/passwd` attempts
   - Symlink-based directory escape
   - URL-encoded path traversal
   - Windows vs Unix path separator handling

2. **YAML Bomb Tests**
   - Exponential entity expansion
   - Deeply nested structures (1000+ levels)
   - Large key/value combinations
   - Billion laughs attack variants

### Security Validation Framework
- Automated security test suite
- Fuzzing for path validation
- Resource monitoring during tests
- Cross-platform security validation

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All directory traversal attacks blocked
- [ ] YAML resource exhaustion attacks prevented
- [ ] Security validations don't break legitimate use cases
- [ ] Performance impact of security checks is minimal (<5ms)
- [ ] Security tests pass on all supported platforms
- [ ] Documentation updated with security considerations
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive path information

## Risk Mitigation
- **Potential Issues**: 
  - Security validations may break existing workflows
  - Performance impact of path validation
  - Platform-specific path handling differences
  - False positives blocking legitimate operations
- **Rollback Strategy**: Git checkpoints before each security implementation
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive attack scenario testing, performance benchmarking

## Success Criteria
- **Primary**: All critical security vulnerabilities patched
- **Secondary**: No regression in legitimate functionality
- **Tertiary**: Security validations add <5ms to operations
- **Quality**: Comprehensive security test coverage with attack scenarios
