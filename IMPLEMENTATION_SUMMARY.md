## Usage Examples

### Running the Modern UI
```bash
go run main.go ui                    # Modern Huh interface (default)
go run main.go ui --app ghostty      # Start with specific app
```

### In-App Controls
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys, Tab, Enter
- **Search**: `/` to focus search, type to filter
- **View switching**: `Ctrl+H` for modern, `Ctrl+L` for legacy
- **Toggle modes**: `t` to show all apps vs available only
- **Help**: `?` for context-aware help
- **Back/Quit**: `Esc` to go back, `q` to quit

## Code Quality
