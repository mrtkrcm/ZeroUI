# Contributing

This project welcomes bug fixes, features, and documentation improvements.

## Development workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change (keep PRs focused).
3. Run checks: `make check` (or at minimum `make test-fast`).
4. Update documentation for user-visible changes.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description and test notes.

## Standards
