# Legacy root-level scripts

This directory contains scripts that used to live at the repository root. They were moved here to reduce clutter. Most of these are demos and ad-hoc test scripts.

If you rely on any of these scripts, update your workflows to reference `scripts/legacy/<script>`.

Consider moving important scripts into `scripts/` (top-level) and turning ad-hoc demos into tests under `tests/`.
